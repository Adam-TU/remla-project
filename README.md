# Release Engineering for Machine Learning Applications 2022, Group 14 project: Continuous Training
Course description:
> In this course, we will go on a journey that starts at continuous integration and then moves on to continuous delivery, continuous deployment, and continuous experimentation. We will discuss the theory and the current research on various related subjects like containerization, testing, or monitoring and will put the learned theory into practice. As a running example, we will build a pipeline for a machine learning application, which – compared to traditional release engineering – poses additional challenges, like data versioning or model deployment.

## Deployment (minikube)
[See the README in `./deployment`](./deployment/README.md)


## Setup development environment

Create virtual environment folder

```
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the environemnt

Windows:

```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Linux:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install all the requirements for the environment

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### pre-commit hook
A pre-commit hook that formats, checks and tests the code using black/isort/flake8/mllint/bandit 
is configured in [`pre-commit.sh`](./pre-commit.sh). To enable git to run it before each commit create a file
`pre-commit` in [`.git/hooks/`](.git/hooks/) with content:
```
#!/bin/sh

sh ./pre-commit.sh
```

## Machine Learning information: Multilabel classification on Stack Overflow tags

Predict tags for posts from StackOverflow with multilabel classification approach.


### Dataset

- Dataset of post titles from StackOverflow


### Transforming text to a vector

- Transformed text data to numeric vectors using bag-of-words and TF-IDF.

### MultiLabel classifier

[MultiLabelBinarizer](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MultiLabelBinarizer.html) to transform labels in a binary form and the prediction will be a mask of 0s and 1s.

[Logistic Regression](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) for Multilabel classification

- Coefficient = 10
- L2-regularization technique

### Evaluation

Results evaluated using several classification metrics:

- [Accuracy](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score.html)
- [F1-score](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.f1_score.html)
- [Area under ROC-curve](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.roc_auc_score.html)
- [Area under precision-recall curve](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.average_precision_score.html#sklearn.metrics.average_precision_score)

### Libraries

- [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) — a package for scientific computing.
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) — a library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) — a tool for data mining and data analysis.
- [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/) — a platform to work with natural language.
