Task 2 - WordsTagsCount

We are assuming that tags_counts and words_counts are dictionaries like {'some_word_or_tag': frequency}. 
After applying the sorting procedure, results will be look like this: [('most_popular_word_or_tag', frequency), ('less_popular_word_or_tag', frequency), ...].

Bag of words

One of the well-known approaches is a bag-of-words representation. To create this transformation, follow the steps:
    Find N most popular words in train corpus and numerate them. Now we have a dictionary of the most popular words.
    For each title in the corpora create a zero vector with the dimension equals to N.
    For each text in the corpora iterate over words which are in the dictionary and increase by 1 the corresponding coordinate.

Let's try to do it for a toy example. Imagine that we have N = 4 and the list of the most popular words is ['hi', 
'you', 'me', 'are'] 

Then we need to numerate them, for example, like this: {'hi': 0, 'you': 1, 'me': 2, 'are': 3}

And we have the text, which we want to transform to the vector: 'hi how are you'

For this text we create a corresponding zero vector: [0, 0, 0, 0]

And iterate over all words, and if the word is in the dictionary, we increase the value of the corresponding position 
in the vector: 'hi':  [1, 0, 0, 0] 'how': [1, 0, 0, 0] # word 'how' is not in our dictionary 'are': [1, 0, 0, 
1] 'you': [1, 1, 0, 1] 

The resulting vector will be: [1, 1, 0, 1]

def my_bag_of_words(text, words_to_index, dict_size):

        if word in words_to_index:
            result_vector[words_to_index[word]] += 1
    return result_vector


"""
TF-IDF

The second approach extends the bag-of-words framework by taking into account total frequencies of words in the corpora. 
It helps to penalize too frequent words and provide better features space.
Implement function tfidf_features using class TfidfVectorizer from scikit-learn. 
Use train corpus to train a vectorizer. 
Suggested: filter out too rare words (occur less than in 5 titles) and 
too frequent words (occur more than in 90% of the titles). 
Also, use bigrams along with unigrams in your vocabulary.
